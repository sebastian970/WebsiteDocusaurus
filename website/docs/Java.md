Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming language.

Java has been one of the most popular programming language for many years.
Java is Object Oriented. However it is not considered as pure object oriented as it provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc)
The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine independent code). Then the byte code is run on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.
Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low level programming functionalities like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects.
Java is used in all kind of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java based), desktop applications, web applications, client server applications, enterprise applications and many more.
